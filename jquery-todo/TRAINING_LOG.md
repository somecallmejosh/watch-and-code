# 8/27/20

Today is my first day. I spent 1:20 reviewing the jQuery Todo code example. I also reviewed the ES6 example. Reminder to self:  need to review .bind() and other methods (I completed the prerequisite course months ago and should probably review the whole thing)

# 8/28/20

JQuery Todo:

- watched “The Steps” video
- Re-reviewed code base
- Began taking notes on application and prepping questions for next meeting

# 8/31/20

Reading exercises:

- Still in the beginning video series, reading the JQuery Todo code and watching the videos.
- Completed video 4: Event Listeners, toggle, delete, filter video. I copied the code down to my local machine to run things locally. It is making it easier for me to track and make notes of things.
- Started on video 5 this morning. Found the commentary around naming methods insightful (specifically the edit method).
- Was not aware of the ability to set a value as an argument for the `.val()` method, and appreciated the clarification that this was extraneous code. I probably wouldn't have thought to dig that deep.

Reading exercises: 

- Unable to attend accountability zoom chat. :-(
- Completed video 5: edit, editKeyup, update
- Began Video 6: Rendering with templates
  - Got through `render()` and `renderFooter()` methods.
  - Read through Handlebars doc on Github

# 9/2/20

Reading exercises:
- Finished Video 6: Rendering with templates.
- I realize this isn't a Handlebars course, but I'm wondering about the benefit of regestering this helper `Handlebars.register('eq', ...)`. Is there a benefit that supercedes the use of a regular conditional for the filter in the footer template?
  - Tested `<a {{#if filter == 'all'}}class="selected"{{/if}} href="#/all">All</a>` in place of `{{#eq ...}}`. Appears to yield the same results.
